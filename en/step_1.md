In Unity, a Tag can be applied to one or more GameObjects so that they can easily be identified. 

The Player tag is included in Unity. 

Select a GameObject and set the Tag to `Player` using the drop-down menu in the Inspector:

You can also add tags. 

Choose any GameObject.

**Tip:** **Add Tag** only creates a new tag, it does not apply it to the GameObject you selected. 

To apply a tag to a GameObject, select the GameObject and click on the tag drop-down menu and choose **Add Tag...** and give your tag a name.

**Tip:** You can select multiple GameObjects using <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then clicking on them. If you set the tag in the Inspector with multiple GameObjects selected, then the tag will be applied to all of the selected GameObjects.
